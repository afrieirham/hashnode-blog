In the frontend, I implement the edit page for the calendars and the students. It is basically the same page as the create student and calendar with just a little more step before that.

I need to fetch the current data to display it on the page first before they made the edits.

This is also why I make new endpoints with the API too today.

Today I also discover a bug with the toggle switch for the calendars. I was confused but I did found the issue and fixed it. Turns out they all have the same HTML id.

I think that is all for today. Thanks.
