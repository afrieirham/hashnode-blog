**Backend**
+ No progress made

### What I did well?
+ Nothing particular

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Took quite some time to figure out the best material-ui component for this. 
    + I was trying to make it look like share component from Figma and make it inline where the `Invite Admin` button is located (see photo below). But I couldn't figure out how to do it with material-ui and settle on using the dialog component instead.

+ Share model from Figma

+ `AdmisListView` component

### How will tomorrow be?
+ There is still quite a lot of UI implementation I need to make. But for tomorrow I think I want to lay out all the UIs needed before connecting it to the backend.
