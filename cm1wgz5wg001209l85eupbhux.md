The best talent comes from referrals.

So how do you convince people to share their referrals? You reward them with cash.

Problem now, how do you avoid people sharing “referrals” mindlessly? You vet them.

1. Reach out to your network, ask if they know someone who’s a. open to work b. they highly recommend.
    
2. Tell them they’ll get rewarded if their referrals are high quality and are a good fit.
    
3. Remind them to make sure it’s high-quality. If not, then don’t ask for referrals from them ever again.
    
4. Make sure to actually reward them when their referrals are a great fit.
    
5. Do this until you get enough pool of high-quality talents endorsed by your trusted network.
    

Now you have the supply side sorted, it’s time to find demands.

This part’s easy, there’s always demand for high-quality talents.

The hard part is to convince the “demanders” (companies) you have the supply.

So reach out to companies, convince them to take a look at your talent pool. Also, tell them if they decide to hire anyone from the pool, they’ll need to pay 10% of the candidate’s first annual salary. If not a good fit, no need to pay.

Also vet the companies too, you need to respect the talent’s privacy. Supply them with good opportunities.

Build trust until you don’t need to convince companies that your talent pool is good, they’ll come if it’s good.

Split the 10% 55:45 with your network.

Your network are happy, they will want to refer more high-quality candidates.

Companies are happy, they will want to get more candidates from you.

You are happy, you’ve fixed the job market.
