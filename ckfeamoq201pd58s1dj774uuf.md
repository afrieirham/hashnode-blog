## FYP-DevLog 005

I'm back, after a week with no progress because I was on holiday.

For today's progress, I implemented 2 endpoint in the frontend, which are the Delete Calendar and the Add New Calendar page. This is just another page of the same thing with my other pages, no real issue.

Trying to get back on track was a bit slow but that is expected. I think that's all for today.

Looking forward to more progress in the upcoming days. Thank you for reading.
