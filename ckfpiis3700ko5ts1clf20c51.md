**Backend**
+ No progress made.

### What I did well?
+ Able to implement [material-ui-dropzone](https://yuvaleros.github.io/material-ui-dropzone/)  quite nicely.
+ Able to replicate the snackbar component that comes with [material-ui-dropzone](https://yuvaleros.github.io/material-ui-dropzone/)  and create a custom snackbar for a feature beyond the package itself. I look into the package's [source code](https://github.com/Yuvaleros/material-ui-dropzone/blob/master/src/components/SnackbarContentWrapper.js) on GitHub.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Not particularly stuck with anything but quite overwhelmed thinking about my next step which is to setup redux and implement it with the backend.
+ That is also why today's progress is quite late because I was watching tutorials about react and redux.
+ All of above might take a while.

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Moving forward I think I want to start implementing redux and also connect the dashboard to the backend.
