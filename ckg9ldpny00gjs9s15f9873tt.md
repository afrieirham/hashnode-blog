**Backend**
+ Return errors when needed in `GET` all invite list endpoint
+ Include created invited admin info in `POST` invite list endpoint
+ Add sorting based on `expired_at` date for `GET` all invite list endpoint
+ Add checking before `DELETE` invite list item

### What I did well?
+ Manage to implement `getInviteList`, `addInviteList`, and `deleteInviteList` for redux
+ May need to rename the actions as it might be confusing now. 

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Not feeling stuck

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Since I have completed the invite-only registration in the admin dashboard, I will start working on the email and completing account for the invited users.
