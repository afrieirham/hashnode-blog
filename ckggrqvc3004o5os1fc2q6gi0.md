**Backend**
+ Some bug fixes

### What I did well?
+ Deployed both the API and React frontend to Heroku and Vercel respectively. It's live now. Also it's satisfying to see this. ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603125933567/37jzLFHqn.png)

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Just feeling a bit tired updating my progress, mostly because I'm spending more than 1 hour and I stopped when I'm tired.

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Will start working on student invite module and student management
