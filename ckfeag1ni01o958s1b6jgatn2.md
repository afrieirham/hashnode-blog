## FYP-DevLog 001

It has been a while since my FYP has any progress at all, and I decided today that I want to spend 1 hour to make some progress. 

And I did it.

Managed to add some new endpoint today and I feel great. In fact I feel like I want to do more but I don't want to spend more than 1 hour in fear of burnout. 

So that's it. One hour a day. No more no less. Wish me luck.
