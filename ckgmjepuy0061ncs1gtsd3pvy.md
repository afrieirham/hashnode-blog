### Progress Made
**Frontend**

    + Create invite one student modal ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603474471711/xaMMoOGkh.png)
    + Create upload csv to invite student modal ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603474500966/bAPjQRvtu.png)
+ Create student profile page ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603474410417/eqFgiyyYG.png)

**Backend**
+ Add description column to course
+ Attach course data with GET single student
+ Add heroku retry deployment script with `heroku releases:retry`
    + Because when the deployment fail after push, you can't retry the deployment without pushing any new commit.

### What I did well?
+ Nothing in particular

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Again, to come up with the final design and layout of the page, spent too much time experimenting

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Continue with connecting the student invite module with the backend.
