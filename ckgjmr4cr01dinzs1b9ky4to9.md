## FYP-DevLog 033

### Progress Made
**Frontend**
+ No progress made

**Backend**
+ Redo database seeder base on environment (i.e. production or development)
+ Completed almost all of the merit module, which is the CRUD actions. Attachment as a proof of the merit is the only part that is not done yet.
+ Create `/auth/me` endpoint to get logged in user profile info

### What I did well?
+ Manage to complete the merit module in a day.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Handling file uploads to AWS S3 as it might be better if I have a centralized uploads table to keep all the url of files uploaded by the users.

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Continue working on the file uploads and integrate it with the merit module.
