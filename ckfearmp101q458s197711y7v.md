## FYP-DevLog 009

Today is housekeeping day, all I did was converting bunch of components into functional components.

The reason for this is I want to try as much as possible to use the modern react. I really likes how functional component handles its state with `useState`, that is mostly why I decided to convert it.

Same thing with the backend. Just some minor bug fixes.

That's all for today. Bye.
