+ Remove activation tab because I think it's no longer needed.

**Backend**
+ No progress made.

### What I did well?
+ Nothing, everything is as usual.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ The color props for the badge I use don't accept colors other than the primary and secondary colors which is not ideal. It would be better if I can use the provided theme colors to better indicate the status of the students.
