**Backend**
+ Created a new endpoint for edit admin (for now just the name)

### What I did well?
+ Manage to do both profile page and edit page relatively quick

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Not sure if I should continue with React Bootstrap
    + Bootstrap is quite limited with its components. 
    + Thinking about switching to Material UI (will take time)

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Setup new react project with Material UI
+ If still have time, implement the Login page.
