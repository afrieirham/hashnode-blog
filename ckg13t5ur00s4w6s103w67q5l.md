## FYP-DevLog 024

> Sorry for the lack of GIFs today, it takes some time to record it and it's getting late already. I may add it tomorrow.

### Progress Made
**Frontend**
+ Implement auto refresh token and only store JWT token in redux state.
+ Create Public and Private route component that redirects user to specific page based on logged in status.
+ Implement redirect to the page that unauthorized user try to access after login.
    + For example if a user try to access the dashboard without login, they will be redirected to the initial page after successful login.

**Backend**
+ Return proper error when refresh token attempt failed.
+ Add invite admin endpoint that enable existing admin to invite new admin via email.
+ Implement exclusive invite-only workflow in the backend.

### What I did well?
+ Able to create the exclusive invite-only workflow which I think is quite cool.
+ Able to handle JWT token in the frontend without using localStorage, except for the other token.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Currently my timing is way off, I did more than 1 hour for almost 3 days now and I'm worried I might face burn out.

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Continue with refining the invite-only workflow on the backend and implement the frontend for that.
