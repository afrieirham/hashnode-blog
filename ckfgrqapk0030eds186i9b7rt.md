**Backend**
+ No progress.

### What I did well?
+ Manage to add (copy and paste) two pages pretty easily. Refactor the code to suit my project's need.
+ Spent more than an hour today because I feel like one hour is just too short now. Moving forward I might do a milestone-based progress instead of an hour. This is mostly because now I'm just re-creating the same page from the old one.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Not feeling stuck.

### How will tomorrow be
+ Continue with the adding more pages like `StudentActivation`, `AddAdmin`, `AddCalendar`, `AddStudent` pages.
