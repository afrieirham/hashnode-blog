**Backend**
+ Refactor error message on login endpoint.

### What I did well?
+ Able to use the [project](https://github.com/afrieirham/proshop-frontend)  I made from udemy course as a reference.

### What I'm stuck with?
+ Having thoughts about refactoring backend responses to make it easier to handle in the frontend.
+ Stuck with backend validation, I'm not sure if/how I should handle error validation from backend. (e.g. Email not unique *which can only be done in the backend)

### How will tomorrow be?
+ Continue implementing more actions to redux.
